# Build Better
A repository to support the energy system community in building high-quality code and applications.


## About build better
This initiative was launched during a workshop at the IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids in Glasgow, Scotland. The purpose of this repository is to provide support to researchers and academics who are working on delivering proof-of-concept projects. It aims to introduce them to good practices that can significantly enhance the impact and maintainability of their work.

The aims of the repository are as follows:
- provide training material for the workshop participants
- provide opportunities for developing skills in building applications
- establish a community workspace where researchers can share good practices and find useful resources


## Contributions

While Build Better is not a comprehensive resource on developing good code, it can greatly benefit from community contributions in maintaining and improving its value over time. Therefore, we encourage and greatly appreciate contributions in the following areas:

- Improving existing data
- Adding use case examples
- Participating in discussions
